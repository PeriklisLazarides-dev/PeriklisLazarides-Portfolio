        <h2>Inroduction</h2>
        <p>
            This game was made during the summer after my second year of my undergraduate degree. <br><br> 
            Spacewalker is inspired by the popular game "Jump Knight", but instead of a constant level layout, it is infinite.
        </p>  

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The main part of the game is to navigate through the randomly generating platforms without messing up.
                Missing the platforms kills the player and resets the run.
                
            </p>

            <h3>Goal of the Game</h3>
            <p>
                Goal of the game is to achive the greatest distance by going from left to right. Highscore is saved and is displayed with the current score in the top left.
            </p>

            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <p>
                Jumping is the backbone of the whole game. When pressing the jump button (spacebar) the character charges their jump, the longer you hold the jump, a larger
                distance will be covered. Of course there is no actual way to tell how high the character will jump, which makes the game difficult.
                <br><br>
                Moving left to right is the standard inpus A and D.
            </p>

            <h2>Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                Special platforms/obstacles to make the game more interesting are added.
                <ul>
                    <li>Teleporting portals.</li>
                    <li>Bouncing platforms</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
               
        <h3>Bouncing platforms</h3>
            <p>
                Bouncing platform are the green platforms seen in the screenshot below, the player cannot land on a bouncing platform wihout bouncing off of it.
                With this introduced mechanic a lot more platform obstacles are made to make the gameplay a bit more difficult and fun.
            </p>

            <h3>Teleportation portals</h3>
            <p>
                Teleportation portals are the blue and orange portals. Colour scheme is chosen to reference the famous Portal games,
                as a result, some players can guess how they work just from their looks. Going into the blue portal teleports you with the
                same momentum through the orange portal. Combining portals and bouncing platforms can make some very interesting obstacles.
            </p>

        <h2>UI and Music/SFX</h2>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, both the high score and current score are being shown in the top left of the screen.
            There is a pause menu that include sound/music settings. Main menu also includes a "how to play/controls" section, where it briefly explains
            the game mechanics to the player.
        </p>

        <h2>Visual effects/Sprites/Particles</h2>
        <p>
            All sprites where created by me, with the use of Asesprite. Particles for the death effect, jetpack trail and walking were made With
            Unity's particel system. Parallax backround was imported as a free online asset.

        </p>

        <h2>Features that I wanted to add</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ice Platforms (more obstacles).</li>
                <li>Input rebiding settings.</li>
                <li>An actual constant map.</li>
                <li>Global Leaderboard</li>
                <li>Achievments</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
