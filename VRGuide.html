    <h1>Guide Script Unity Project</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This is a script designed to be added to any 3D Unity project as a script for a guide character/NPC controlled by scriptable objects.
             This project was made by Periklis Lazarides during his summer internship at CYENS. The Scene provided in the project acts as a "demo"
              of how the guide script can be used.
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>Unity 6 (preferably)</p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>Guide script uses a Finite State Machine (FSM). Having 3 different states:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moving State: The state where the guide moves from one set point to another.</li>
            <li>Explaining State: The state where the guide arrives at a set point and gives information to the players.</li>
            <li>Reminder State: The state where the guide makes sure to remind the player of the current objective.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The movement of the Guide is done with the help of "NavMesh Agent" component. This allows the user to make more complex paths for the agent.</p>
